Hi, I'm Henry Abrahamsen, (he/him). 

I'm a junior software engineer without much formal training.
I've been coding for several years and have slowly been understanding what I'm doing.

Most of my projects are pretty useless, but each year the projects become a little cooler.
A list of my major projects can be found on my website **[henhen1227.com](https://henhen1227.com/overview)**.

I'm always learning new stuff, and there's so much I want to do!

You can contact me at Henry@henhen1227.com or henhen1227@gmail.com
